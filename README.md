# code-interpreter

- Python & JS/TS SDK for running AI-generated code/code interpreting in your AI app? Bring Code Execution to Your AI Applications?  Execute LLM-generated code seamlessly with a simple API call. Code Interpreter (TCI) enables you to execute Python code in a sandboxed environment.
The Code Interpreter currently only supports Python. We plan to expand the language options in the future.

Reinforcement learning (RL) training: TCI transforms code execution into an interactive RL environment where generated code is run and evaluated in real time, providing reward signals from successes or failures, integrating automated pass/fail tests, and scaling easily across parallel workers—thus creating a powerful feedback loop that refines coding models over many trials.
Developing agentic workflows: TCI allows AI agents to seamlessly write and execute Python code, enabling robust, iterative, and secure computations within a closed-loop system.
